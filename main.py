# Accessibility Data from Overpass API (OSM)
# ---------------------------------------------------
# This route lets you check for accessibility features around a location.
# You provide latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) as query parameters in the URL.
# The API will search for nearby toilets, wheelchair-accessible locations, and buildings with ramps.
# The search radius is 500 meters around the provided coordinates.
# The results are fetched from the Overpass API, which is a read-only API for OpenStreetMap data.
# The response includes a list of accessible elements found within the search radius.
# If no accessible elements are found, the list will be empty.
# If there's an error (e.g., invalid coordinates), the API will return an error message with details.

# To access copy and paste this URL in a new tab: https://5145f266-a838-466f-ad64-71e0143d10c2-00-1ohv6j7rjecxx.pike.replit.dev/accessibility?lat=-33.8688&lon=151.2093
# Replace the lat and lon with the location you want to check.
# The coordinates provided are for the Sydney Opera House.
# The API will return a list of accessible elements found within 500 meters of the Sydney Opera House.
# If no accessible elements are found, the list will be empty.
